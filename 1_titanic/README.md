# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project predicts the survival during the titanic disaster based on socio-economic passengers data. The projects features data cleaning, feature engineering, one-hot encoding, feature selection and classifier fitting. The best classifier is Random Forest, with a train accuracy of 0.98 and an F1-score of 0.98. The kaggle submission scores 0.77 on the test set.

## Install

Install Anaconda or Miniconda, install and activate the `py-data` environment.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml 
conda activate py-data
```

## Run the notebook

```
jupyter lab

## Data Set

The training set is used to build the machine learning models.
The test is used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.

- *pclass*: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

- *age*: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

- *sibsp*: The dataset defines family relations in this way :
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

- *parch*: The dataset defines family relations in this way :
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
